# Motor-temperature-prediction
Motor temperature prediction based on residual connection and GRU. This is a multi-attribute time series prediction problem

Res_ GRU. py is the training and prediction process of the model. The structure diagram of the model is shown in Figure model_ Structure.svg

final_ Try.py is an integrated learning method based on bagging

AdaBoost.py is an integrated learning method based on Boosting

It seems that bagging's prediction results are better on this issue

Lib.py stores the model and some auxiliary functions
